The Python code you provided is a function called get_age() that gets 
the user's age from input and a main function that calls the get_age() 
function and prints a message to the console depending on whether the user is eligible or not.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

def get_age():
  age_str = input("Please enter your age: ")     
  if age_str.isnumeric() and int(age_str) >= 18:
    return int(age_str)
  else:
    return None

The get_age() function takes no arguments and returns the user's age as an integer, 
or None if the user's input is invalid. First, it prompts the user to enter their age.
Then, it checks if the user's input is a numeric string. If it is, and the integer 
value of the string is greater than or equal to 18, then the function returns the integer value of the string. 
Otherwise, the function returns None.

def main():
  age = get_age()
  if age is not None:                  
   print(f"You are {age} years old and eligible.")
  else:
   print("Invalid input. You must be at least 18 years old.")

The main() function takes no arguments and returns nothing.
It first calls the get_age() function and assigns the returned value to the variable age.
Then, it checks if the age variable is not None. If it is not,
then the function prints a message to the console indicating that the user is eligible.
Otherwise, the function prints a message to the console indicating that the user's input is invalid.

if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()

The if __name__ == "__main__": block is a common way to ensure that the main() 
function is only called when the script is run directly, and not when it is imported as a module.

Here is an example of how to run the Python script:

>>> main()
Please enter your age: 25
You are 25 years old and eligible.

If the user enters an invalid age, the following output will be printed to the console:

>>> main()
Please enter your age: 17
Invalid input. You must be at least 18 years old
