The Python code you provided for the merge sort algorithm can be broken down as follows:

def merge_sort(arr):
  if len(arr) <= 1:
    return arr
This function definition defines a new function called merge_sort(),
which takes an array as input and returns a sorted array as output.
The function first checks if the length of the input array is less than or equal to 1. If it is, 
then the array is already sorted and the function simply returns the array.

mid = len(arr) // 2
left = arr[:mid]
right = arr[mid:]
Next, the function calculates the middle element of the input array and stores it in the variable mid.
The function then divides the input array into two halves at the middle element and stores
the two halves in the variables left and right.

merge_sort(left)
merge_sort(right)
The function then recursively calls itself on the two halves of the input array.
This means that the function will recursively divide the array into smaller and
smaller subarrays until each subarray contains only a single element.
At that point, the subarrays will already be sorted and the function will simply return them.

i = j = k = 0
Next, the function declares three variables: i, j, and k. 
These variables will be used to track the positions of 
the elements in the two sorted halves of the input array and in the final sorted array, respectively.

while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
    if left[i] < right[j]:
      arr[k] = left[i]
      i += 1
    else:
      arr[k] = right[j]
      j += 1
    k += 1
This while loop merges the two sorted halves of the input array into the final sorted array.
The loop works by comparing the elements of the two halves one by one and copying the smaller
element to the final sorted array. If the elements are equal, then the order of the elements is preserved.

while i < len(left):
    arr[k] = left[i]
    i += 1
    k += 1
   
  while j < len(right):
    arr[k] = right[j]
    j += 1
    k += 1  
  return arr # Return the sorted array
After the while loop has finished, any remaining elements in the two sorted halves of the
input array will be copied to the final sorted array.
Finally, the function returns the final sorted array.

This is a simplified breakdown of the merge sort algorithm.
The merge sort algorithm you provided is correct and efficient. 
It is a recursive algorithm that works by dividing the array into smaller subarrays,
sorting each subarray, and then merging the sorted subarrays back together.
The algorithm has a worst-case time complexity of O(n log n) and an average time complexity of O(n log n).
It is also a stable sort, which means that it preserves the original order of equal elements in the array.

The following output:

The sorted array is: [3, 9, 10, 27, 38, 43, 82]
Here is a breakdown of how the merge sort algorithm works on your example array:

The array is divided into two equal halves: [38, 27, 43] and [3, 9, 82, 10].
Each half is then recursively sorted using the merge sort algorithm.
The two sorted halves are then merged together to form the final sorted array.
The merging process is done by comparing the elements of the two halves one by one and 
copying the smaller element to the final sorted array. If the elements are equal, then the order of the elements is preserved.

The merge sort algorithm is a very efficient and versatile sorting algorithm.
It is often used in real-world applications, such as sorting database records or files on a computer.
