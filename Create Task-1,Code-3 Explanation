The code you provided is a Python function called read_and_write_file() that takes a filename
as input and reads the contents of the file, converts all of the text to uppercase, and then 
appends the converted text back to the file. The function also prints a message to the console 
indicating whether the file was processed successfully or not.

The main() function simply calls the read_and_write_file() function with the filename "sample.txt".

Here is a breakdown of the code:-

def read_and_write_file(filename):
This is the definition of the read_and_write_file() function.
It takes a filename as input and returns nothing.

try:
This is a try block. 
It is used to handle any errors that may occur while executing the code inside the block.

with open(filename, 'r') as file:
This opens the file for reading using the open() function.
The with statement ensures that the file is closed automatically after it is no longer needed.

content = file.read()
This reads the entire contents of the file into a variable called content.

with open(filename, 'a') as file:
This opens the file for appending using the open() function.

file.write(content.upper())
This appends the converted text to the file.

print(f"File '{filename}' processed successfully.")
This prints a message to the console indicating that the file was processed successfully.

except FileNotFoundError:
This is an except block. It is used to handle the specific case of the file not being found.

print(f"File '{filename}' not found.")
This prints a message to the console indicating that the file was not found.


except Exception as e:
This is a catch-all except block. It is used to handle any other errors that may occur while executing the code inside the try block.

print(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")
This prints a message to the console indicating that an error occurred and then prints the error message.

def main():
This is the definition of the main() function. It takes no input and returns nothing.

filename = "sample.txt"
read_and_write_file(filename)
This calls the read_and_write_file() function with the filename "sample.txt".

if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()
This is a Python idiom that is used to ensure that the main() function is 
only called when the script is executed directly and not when it is imported as a module.

To use the code, simply save it as a Python file (e.g. read_and_write_file.py) and then run it in a terminal or command prompt.
For example, on macOS or Linux, you would run the following command:

python read_and_write_file.py
If the file "sample.txt" exists, the function will read its contents, convert all of the text to uppercase, and 
then append the converted text back to the file.
The function will then print a message to the console indicating that the file was processed successfully.

If the file "sample.txt" does not exist, the function will print a message to the console indicating that the file was not found.

If any other error occurs, the function will print a message to the console indicating that an error occurred and then print the error message.
