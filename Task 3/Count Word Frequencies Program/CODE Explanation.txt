Line 1: This line imports the string and collections modules.
 The string module provides a variety of functions for working with strings, 
 and the collections module provides a variety of data structures, including the Counter object.

Line 3: This line defines a function called count_word_frequencies(),
 which takes a text string as input and returns a dictionary of word frequencies.

Lines 4-6: These lines implement the count_word_frequencies() function.
 The function first removes punctuation from the text string and converts it to lowercase.
 It then splits the text string into a list of words. Finally,
 it creates a Counter object to count the frequency of each word in the list and returns the Counter object.

Line 8: This line prompts the user to enter a text string.

Line 9: This line calls the count_word_frequencies() function to count the
 word frequencies in the text string entered by the user.

Line 10: This line assigns the result of the count_word_frequencies()
 function to the word_frequencies variable.

Lines 12-14: These lines iterate over the dictionary of word frequencies and
 print each word and its frequency to the console.
 The f-string syntax is used to format the output.
