 
The functions are well-defined and modular, making the code easy to maintain and extend.

Here are some specific comments:

The display_list() function is clear and concise.
 It checks if the to-do list is empty, and if not, it prints the list of tasks, numbered sequentially.

The add_task() function is also clear and concise. 
It splits the input string into a list of tasks, and then adds those tasks to the to-do list.
It also prints a message to the user indicating how many tasks were added.

The remove_task() function is a bit more complex, but it is still well-written. 
It first validates the task index to make sure that it is within the bounds of the to-do list.
 If the index is valid, it removes the task at that index and prints a message to the user indicating which task was removed.

The main()
function is the main entry point for the program. 
It creates an empty to-do list and then displays a menu to the user. 

The user can then select one of the following options:
Display the to-do list
Add tasks to the to-do list
Remove a task from the to-do list
Quit the program
The main() function validates the user's input and then calls the appropriate function based on the user's selection.

Overall, this is a well-written and easy-to-use Python to-do list program.
